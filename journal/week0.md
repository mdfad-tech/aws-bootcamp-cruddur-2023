### Additional Self-Created Challenges
- [x] **Used aws-vault for programmatic access to better manage aws access keys locally by storing it in local keychain**<br>
  - Used an open-source solution to manage programmatic access locally. It stores the access keys in the local keychain. Security first! -> https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault
  ![aws-vault](assets/W1_HC_use_aws-vault_for_programmatic_access_awscli.png "aws-vault")
- [x] **Created addtional Service Control Policies as account guardrails**<br>
  - Implemented some of examples provided by AWS in the documentation here -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.html
  - Did this so as to prevent any unecessary resources being build in regions that I do not use.
